# Project Explanation

I built a Starbucks Nutrition Dashboard using Power BI to analyze the nutritional content of various Starbucks beverages. The goal was to make it easier for users to discover drinks based on their health preferences—such as high protein, low sugar, or caffeine-rich options.

The dashboard includes multiple visualizations like bar charts, donut charts, and interactive tables. It highlights the drinks with the highest caffeine, protein, and vitamin C content. It also shows the average calorie breakdown based on preparation style and milk type. In addition, it places a special focus on trans fat content to raise awareness about heart health risks.

The data was imported from an Excel file, which I cleaned and transformed using Power BI’s Power Query Editor. I used measures and calculated columns in DAX to extract insights and ensure accurate analysis.

The entire dashboard is user-friendly, interactive, and designed in a way that even a non-technical person can use it to make better drink choices.

# Why I Selected This Project

I chose this project because Starbucks is a globally recognized brand, and people often enjoy their drinks without fully understanding the nutritional impact. I wanted to create something that was not only visually appealing but also practically useful to a wide range of users.
This topic also connects health and data together—which I found interesting. It gave me a chance to solve a real-world problem using data visualization tools.

# What I Learned

What I Learned:

- How to import and clean data in Power BI using Power Query.
- The use of DAX formulas to create custom measures (like total calories, vitamins, caffeine mg, etc.).
- Designing a multi-page interactive dashboard with clear storytelling.
- How to structure and present data visually so that even complex nutritional info becomes easy to understand.
- The importance of user experience (UX) and keeping dashboards neat, engaging, and meaningful.
- Gained better insight into data-driven decision making, especially in the health and nutrition domain.
